DevOps plays an essential role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
It ensures that software is developed, tested, and deployed in a continuous and automated manner. 
Through DevOps practices, teams can detect issues earlier, reduce manual effort, and improve code quality.
Automation, collaboration, and continuous feedback help integrate all SDLC phases—from planning and coding 
to testing and release—making the development process more efficient and reliable.
