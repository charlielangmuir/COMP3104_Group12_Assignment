DevOps plays a vital role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
It encourages automation, continuous testing, and monitoring at every stage of development. 
By integrating DevOps practices, teams can reduce deployment time, detect bugs earlier, and improve software reliability. 
Overall, DevOps transforms the SDLC from a slow, manual process into a fast, efficient, and collaborative workflow.
