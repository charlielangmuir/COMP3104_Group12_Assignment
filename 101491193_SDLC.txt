DevOps plays a vital role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
It integrates development, testing, deployment, and monitoring into a single continuous process. 
Through automation and collaboration, DevOps ensures faster feedback loops, reduces manual errors, and improves overall software quality. 
By applying DevOps practices, organizations can move from traditional waterfall models to more agile and efficient workflows.
