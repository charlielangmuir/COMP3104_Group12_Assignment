DevOps plays a key role in modern software development lifecycle (SDLC).  
It helps automate testing, deployment, and infrastructure management throughout the process.  
By integrating DevOps early in SDLC, teams achieve faster delivery and better code stability.  
Continuous feedback and monitoring reduce bugs and improve collaboration among developers.  
DevOps ensures that every phase—from planning to maintenance—is efficient and traceable.  
In short, it transforms the traditional SDLC into an agile, automated, and collaborative system.
