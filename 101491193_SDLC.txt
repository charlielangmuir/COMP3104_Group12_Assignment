DevOps plays an essential role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by bridging the gap between development and operations. 
It promotes a culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement. 
Integrating DevOps into the SDLC helps reduce software delivery time, increase reliability, and ensure rapid feedback. 
As a result, teams can release updates more frequently and maintain higher software quality throughout the lifecycle.
