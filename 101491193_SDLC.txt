DevOps plays a key role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
It ensures that code is built, tested, and deployed faster with fewer errors. 
By using CI/CD pipelines, developers can continuously deliver updates and improve the quality of software. 
In short, DevOps brings development and operations together for smoother, faster, and more predictable releases.
