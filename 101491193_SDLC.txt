DevOps plays a critical role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It bridges the gap between development and operations, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery.  

Traditional SDLC models, like Waterfall, often created silos between teams.  
With DevOps, communication and automation are key â€” allowing developers to deliver updates continuously.  

Incorporating DevOps into SDLC leads to shorter feedback loops,  
better quality assurance, and a smoother deployment process for end-users.
