DevOps plays a vital role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
It bridges the gap between developers and operations teams, promoting collaboration and faster feedback loops. 
By integrating CI/CD practices into each phase of SDLC, teams can detect errors earlier, automate testing, and ensure continuous delivery. 
Ultimately, DevOps transforms the SDLC from a slow, manual process into an agile and efficient pipeline that delivers value continuously.
