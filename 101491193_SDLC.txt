The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) describes the process of planning, designing, building, testing, and deploying software.  
DevOps plays an important role in SDLC by automating the deployment and testing phases.  
This helps reduce human error, speeds up release cycles, and ensures consistent quality.  
By integrating DevOps into SDLC, teams can continuously improve their software products.
