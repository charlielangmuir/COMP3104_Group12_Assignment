DevOps is a crucial component of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), bringing development and operations together into a seamless, unified workflow.
In traditional models, developers focused on coding while operations teams managed deployment and maintenanceâ€”often causing bottlenecks and communication gaps.
DevOps addresses these challenges through automation, continuous integration, testing, and deployment, fostering greater collaboration and efficiency.
SDLC is very new to me but prof. Patel is making it very easy to understand :).
