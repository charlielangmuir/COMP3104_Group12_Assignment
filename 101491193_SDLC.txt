DevOps plays a vital role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by integrating development and operations into a unified process. 
Traditionally, developers wrote code while operations teams handled deployment and maintenance, often leading to delays and communication issues. 
With DevOps, automation and collaboration tools help ensure continuous integration, testing, and deployment throughout the SDLC. 
This approach shortens release cycles, improves system reliability, and allows teams to respond quickly to user feedback. 
In modern software engineering, DevOps is no longer optionalâ€”it is an essential part of achieving efficiency and scalability.
