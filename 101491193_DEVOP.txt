The COMP 3104 DevOps course introduces students to modern software development practices. 
It focuses on automation, continuous integration, and collaboration between developers and operations teams. 
Through this course, I learned how to use Git, GitHub Actions, and Docker to streamline development workflows. 
DevOps helps bridge the gap between coding and deployment, making projects more reliable and efficient.
