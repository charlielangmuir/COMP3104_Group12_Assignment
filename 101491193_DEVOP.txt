DevOps is a combination of Development and Operations that promotes better collaboration and automation. 
It aims to shorten the software development lifecycle and deliver applications more efficiently. 
In the COMP3104 DevOps course, we learn about continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), version control with Git, and cloud-based deployment pipelines. 
These practices help teams deliver reliable software faster and with fewer errors.
