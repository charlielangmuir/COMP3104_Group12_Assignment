The COMP3104 DevOps course introduces students to modern software development practices.  
It focuses on Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and automation tools.  

We learn how to use GitHub Actions to automatically test and deploy code.  
DevOps is not only about tools â€” it's a culture of collaboration between developers and operations teams.  

Through this course, I gained experience with Git branching,  
workflow automation, and team collaboration using pull requests and CI/CD pipelines.
