The COMP3104 DevOps course introduces key principles such as automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CI/CD). 
Students learn how to use tools like GitHub Actions, Docker, and Jenkins to streamline development workflows. 
The goal of DevOps is to improve collaboration between developers and operations teams, reduce deployment risks, and deliver software faster and more reliably. 
Through labs and group assignments, students gain practical experience in applying these concepts.
