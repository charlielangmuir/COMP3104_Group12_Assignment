DevOps familiarizes students with the methods that connect development and operations teams.
The course emphasizes automation, collaboration, and the principles of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD).
Students gain hands-on experience with tools like Git, GitHub Actions, Docker, and Jenkins to optimize and automate deployment pipelines.
By the end of the course, they understand how DevOps minimizes manual errors, enhances software quality, and accelerates reliable releases.
I hope to learn how to work seamlessly in the industry by the end of my devops course!
