The COMP 3104 DevOps course teaches students how to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. 
Through hands-on exercises, we learn about continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), automation tools, and collaboration in teams. 
The course also emphasizes version control with Git, build pipelines using GitHub Actions, and teamwork through branching strategies and pull requests.
