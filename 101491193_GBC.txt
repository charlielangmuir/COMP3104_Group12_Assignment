George Brown College is one of the leading colleges in Toronto, Canada. 
It offers practical and career-focused programs that help students gain hands-on experience. 
The college has three main campuses located downtown, making it easy for students to access resources and build industry connections. 
I like that most courses emphasize real-world projects and teamwork.
